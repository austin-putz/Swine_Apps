# Pedigree Shiny App

This will take a pedigree with 3 columns (Animal, Sire, Dam) and calculate inbreeding, relationships, and count sibs and offspring. 

Here is the link to see it in action!

All you need is a .csv file with your pedigree and it will find and enter it.

003,SireB,DamA
004,SireB,DamA
005,SireC,DamB
